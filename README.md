# python-refresher

Implemented `get_columns()` function in `my_utils.py`. This function takes in three mandatory arguments: (1) filename (located in same directory as the Python script), (2) column number to check, and (3) a value to check for in that column. By default, the return in a `numpy.array` containing the file's second column for all matched rows. The returned column can be changed using an optional `result_column` argument.

I also added a `print_fires.py` that uses `get_columns()` to find fire data for the United States of America, and `run.sh` to run `print_fires.py`.
